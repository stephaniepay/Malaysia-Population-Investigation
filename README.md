## Background
A comprehensive suite of 6 interactive visualizations is developed. It is aimed at facilitating a detailed population analysis of Malaysia. Our core domain was to delve into the population structure across various dimensions, including industry, state, ethnic group, and gender over different years. Our visualization consists of a choropleth map, a grouped bar chart, a scatterplot, a circular packing chart, several line graphs, and a dashboard. Each of these visualizations provides a unique perspective on the population data, allowing for a multi-faceted examination of the demographics.

The datasets were retrieved from 4 official platforms: The Jabatan Perangkaan Malaysia, Department of Statistics Malaysia Official Portal, Department of Statistics Malaysia e-statistics, and The World Bank Data.

#### Datasets Applied:
- Fertility Rate by year, state, age group
- Life Expectancy by state, gender, year
- Employed Population by year, gender, industry
- Population by states, year, age group, gender, ethnic group
- Number of deaths by state, year, gender, age group
