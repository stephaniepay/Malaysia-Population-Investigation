## Background
We successfully developed a comprehensive suite of 6 interactive visualizations, aimed at facilitating a detailed population analysis of Malaysia. Our core domain was to delve into the population structure across various dimensions, including industry, state, ethnic group, and gender over different years. Our visualization consists of a choropleth map, a grouped bar chart, a scatterplot, a circular packing chart, several line graphs, and a dashboard. Each of these visualizations provides a unique perspective on the population data, allowing for a multi-faceted examination of the demographics.
